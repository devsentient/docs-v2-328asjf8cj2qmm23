# What is Shakudo
Shakudo is an end-to-end platform that provides the maximum flexibility on data tooling. On Shakudo, you get access to best-of-breed data tools and applications without DevOps overhead, all within your own cloud or on prem environment. Read more on [our website](https://shakudo.io/).


On Shakudo, the workflow is simplified with the Shakudo components:

- **Sessions** are unified development environments with pre-configured packages, mounted credentials, network connections and connections to other components in your Shakudo environment to quickly start building.

- **Jobs** are batch job deployment orchestration. you can use any git repositories, which are developed and pushed in the sessions, or anywhere else. You can also deploy a pre-built Docker images. Jobs can be triggered on a schedule or with any [KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/2.10/scalers/).

- **Services** are microservices for backends and dashboards. Similar to jobs, you can use git repositories or pre-built Docker images. A Service exposes an endpoint, which can be a dashboard, a website or an API endpoint.

- **Shakudo Stack Components** is a universe of pre-configured fully-connected, ever-evolving data stack that supports end to end use cases of data and machine learning applications.
